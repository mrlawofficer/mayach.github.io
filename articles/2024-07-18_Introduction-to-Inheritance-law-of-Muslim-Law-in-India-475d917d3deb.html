This framework ensures that both male and female heirs have defined rights and privileges over inherited property. This section delves into the specifics of these principles, focusing on the rights of women, heritable property, and the absence of the right by birth.</p><p name="9c5f" id="9c5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Single Scheme of Succession:</strong></p><p name="a178" id="a178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under Muslim law, succession is based primarily on blood relations (consanguinity), and marital relations do not influence inheritance rights. A woman, whether a daughter, sister, or mother, acquires an absolute right to any property she inherits, with full powers of alienation. Her inheritance rights and control over property remain intact even after marriage, and her identity is maintained independently of her husband or parents. This means that her heirs are her blood relations, not those of her husband. For instance, if a woman inherits property from her husband and dies without children, her parents, rather than her husband’s heirs, would inherit her property.</p><p name="f0e9" id="f0e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Heritable Property:</strong></p><p name="54a7" id="54a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Muslim law imposes restrictions on the bequeathal of property. A Muslim cannot bequeath more than one-third of their estate without the consent of their heirs. Consequently, even if a Will is made, two-thirds of the estate will generally pass by intestate succession unless the heirs consent to the excess bequest. If no Will is made, the entire property is distributed according to intestate succession rules.</p><p name="c6fd" id="c6fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before distributing the estate, certain expenses and liabilities must be settled, including funeral expenses, unpaid debts, unpaid dower to the widow, incidental expenses, and costs for obtaining letters of administration. These deductions are made from the estate before distribution among the heirs. There is no distinction between movable and immovable property or separate and ancestral property in the inheritance rules.</p><p name="e0a6" id="e0a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">No Recognition of Right by Birth:</strong></p><p name="c0a6" id="c0a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Muslim law does not recognize the concept of ancestral or coparcenary property, nor does it grant any right by birth in the father’s property to the son during the father’s lifetime. The father retains full powers of alienation over his property during his life, meaning he can gift or sell it as he wishes. The son only has a hope or chance (spes successionis) to inherit the property, contingent upon surviving the father and the availability of property at the father’s death. If the father disposes of the property, nothing remains for the son to inherit.</p><p name="3a4d" id="3a4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For instance, if a father gifts his property during his lifetime, the son cannot challenge the gift on the grounds of being the future owner. The son’s rights only become vested upon the father’s death, allowing him to challenge the validity of the gift if necessary.</p><p name="0377" id="0377" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion:</strong></p><p name="f1e0" id="f1e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The principles of succession under Muslim law emphasize consanguinity and equitable distribution among blood relations, ensuring that women have absolute rights over their inherited property. The framework does not recognize ancestral property or the right by birth, granting full control of property to the owner during their lifetime. This system ensures clarity and fairness in the distribution of heritable property, reinforcing the importance of blood relations over marital connections in inheritance matters.</p></div></div></section><section name="d6c0" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3417" id="3417" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Question: </strong>What are the principles regarding the renunciation of the right to succeed, the transfer of spes successionis, vested interests upon inheritance, and succession under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, under Muslim law?</h3><h3 name="17d9" id="17d9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Answer:</h3><p name="ceaa" id="ceaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Introduction:</strong></p><p name="87b3" id="87b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The principles of succession under Muslim law emphasize the prohibition of transferring or renouncing the mere chance of inheritance (spes successionis), the immediate vesting of interest upon inheritance, and the specific rules applicable when marriages are performed or registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. This section elucidates these aspects in detail.</p><p name="fb7c" id="fb7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Renunciation of Right to Succeed or Transfer of Spes Successionis:</strong></p><p name="d21c" id="d21c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under Muslim law, a mere chance of inheritance, known as spes successionis, cannot be transferred or renounced. Although Chapter II of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which prohibits the transfer of spes successionis, does not apply to Muslims, the effect of Muslim law itself expressly prohibits it. The prospective right of an heir apparent cannot be subject to a valid transfer. However, if an expectant heir receives consideration and misleads the owner, they can be debarred from claiming inheritance when succession opens.</p><p name="0c65" id="0c65" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Illustration:</strong></p><p name="1485" id="1485" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the case of Ghulam Abas v. Haji Kayyum Ali, a Muslim man had a wife, five sons, and two daughters. During his lifetime, he incurred debts that could have exhausted his estate. Three of his financially comfortable sons paid off his debts. In return, the other two sons relinquished their inheritance claims. The Supreme Court held that the relinquishing sons, having received consideration and misled the owner, could not later claim their inheritance rights.</p><p name="0f74" id="0f74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vested Interest Upon Inheritance:</strong></p><p name="8d41" id="8d41" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The heirs gain a vested interest in the intestate’s estate the moment succession opens, and their ownership is not dependent on the actual distribution of the property. Upon the intestate’s death, each competent heir’s share is vested in them. If an heir dies before the property is physically divided, their share passes to their legal representatives, not to other heirs.</p><p name="f05f" id="f05f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Illustration:</strong></p><p name="2537" id="2537" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A Muslim man, A, has two sons, S1 and S2. A dies, leaving behind a house and some other property. Both sons are married with families. Before the property is divided, S1 dies. S1’s share, fixed at half, will pass to his widow and son, not to the surviving brother, S2.</p><p name="07f4" id="07f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Succession Where Marriage is Under the Special Marriage Act, 1954:</strong></p><p name="7d7e" id="7d7e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If a Muslim gets married under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, or registers their marriage under this Act, the Muslim law of inheritance does not apply. Instead, the Indian Succession Act, 1925 governs the succession to their property. This rule applies irrespective of whether the spouse is Muslim or non-Muslim. The Special Marriage Act, 1954, supersedes the earlier Special Marriage Act, 1872, retaining the identical provision that the inheritance laws applicable under Muslim law will not govern such marriages.</p><p name="1a46" id="1a46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion:</strong></p><p name="82b0" id="82b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The principles under Muslim law ensure the protection of inheritance rights by prohibiting the transfer or renunciation of the mere chance of inheritance (spes successionis) and establishing the immediate vesting of interest upon inheritance. Additionally, the rules adapt when marriages are conducted or registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, ensuring that inheritance is governed by the Indian Succession Act, 1925, rather than Muslim law. These provisions ensure clarity and fairness in the distribution and management of heritable property among heirs.</p></div></div></section><section name="0a80" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="666b" id="666b" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Question: </strong>What are the disqualifications for inheritance under Muslim law, and how do these rules affect individuals based on religion, homicide, and the legitimacy of children?</h3><h3 name="81bd" id="81bd" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Answer:</h3><p name="7438" id="7438" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Introduction:</strong></p><p name="2044" id="2044" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under Muslim law, certain individuals who would otherwise be eligible to inherit may be disqualified based on specific grounds.

A non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim intestate. However, this strict rule was modified by the Caste Disabilities Removal Act, 1850, which protected the inheritance rights of converts. For example, if a Muslim man has a son who converts to Christianity, this convert son would still be entitled to inherit his father’s property due to the Act. Conversely, if a Hindu married man converts to Islam and then dies, his Hindu son cannot inherit his property under Muslim law.</li><li name="2097" id="2097" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Homicide: </strong>A person who causes the death of another is disqualified from inheriting the deceased’s property, whether through intestate or testamentary succession. Under Sunni law, this rule applies strictly regardless of whether the death was intentional or accidental. In contrast, Shia law disqualifies only those who intentionally cause death.</li><li name="c5db" id="c5db" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Illegitimate Child: </strong>Legitimacy in Muslim law is linked to the lawful wedlock of the parents. A child born within six months of marriage is presumed legitimate unless the father disclaims paternity through ‘lian’ (accusation of adultery). A legitimate child has inheritance rights, while an illegitimate child does not. The legitimacy can be established through direct or indirect proof of marriage, presumption, or acknowledgment by the father. However, acknowledgment cannot legitimize a child born from a union where the parents could not have legally married, such as cases of adultery or prohibited degrees of relationship.</li></ol><p name="92b7" id="92b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Illustrations and Details:</strong></p><p name="54ac" id="54ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Convert’s Inheritance Rights:</strong></p><ul class="postList"><li name="53eb" id="53eb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">If a Muslim man has a son who converts to Christianity, under classical Muslim law, this convert son would not inherit.
