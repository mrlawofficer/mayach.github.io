The Supreme Court held that even if the marriage was void, it did not obliterate the disqualification from inheritance by reason of remarriage. The court opined that statutory prohibition of bigamy is a prohibitory statute, not a conferring statute, and thus the void marriage would still be treated as a remarriage for terminating her rights in the limited estate.</p><h4 name="e26f" id="e26f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Critique of the Judgment</strong></h4><p name="143c" id="143c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Supreme Court’s interpretation faced criticism.

Upon the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the widow bequeathed her share to a relative. The adopted son challenged this, arguing that the widow’s interest in the property was limited and could not mature into absolute ownership under Section 14(1).</p><p name="82a2" id="82a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Supreme Court’s Observations:</strong></p><p name="4d50" id="4d50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the constitutionality of Section 14(1).

Before the Act, women had limited interests in property, often given to them in lieu of maintenance. The Act aimed to convert these limited interests into absolute ownership, thereby providing women with full control over their property.</p><h4 name="0287" id="0287" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Limited Interest in Lieu of Maintenance:</strong></h4><p name="8dd3" id="8dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Traditionally, Hindu women were economically dependent on men. Their entitlement to property was closely linked to their need for maintenance. Under the Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act, 1937, widows were given a share in their husband’s property in lieu of maintenance. However, this share reverted to the husband’s heirs upon the widow’s death. This arrangement underscored the limited nature of the widow’s interest in the property.</p><h4 name="e80c" id="e80c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Conversion of Limited Interests:</strong></h4><p name="ec8d" id="ec8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, transformed the limited interests of Hindu widows into absolute ownership. Section 14(1) of the Act states that any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of the Act, shall be held by her as full owner and not as a limited owner. This provision effectively converted the widow’s limited estate into an absolute estate.</p><h4 name="a1fc" id="a1fc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Key Judgments and Principles:</strong></h4><p name="d930" id="d930" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1.

Prior to 1956, such property was considered her stridhan, and she had absolute rights over it except during coverture, where the husband’s consent was necessary for its disposal. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, ensured that any property received as a gift is held absolutely by the woman without any restrictions.</p><h4 name="217c" id="217c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">By Personal Skill or Exertion:</strong></h4><p name="31b9" id="31b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Property acquired by a woman through her skill, exertion, art, or special learning, such as a salary, share in profits, or through trade or business, has always been considered her exclusive property. Although historically her absolute power over this property was constrained during marriage, requiring her husband’s consent for disposal, the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, removed this restriction. Now, even during marriage, a woman is free to dispose of her property as she pleases.</p><h4 name="5253" id="5253" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">By Purchase and Prescription:</strong></h4><p name="1586" id="1586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Property purchased with a woman’s own funds is her absolute property, with full powers of disposal. This provision affirms a woman’s right to independently own and manage property acquired through her resources.</p><h4 name="240d" id="240d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Acquired in Any Other Manner:</strong></h4><p name="e952" id="e952" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Act provides that any property acquired by a woman in any other manner, not specifically mentioned above, will be held by her as an absolute owner. This broad clause encompasses property received under a decree or award or through adverse possession. For instance, if a widow receives compensation from the government for ancestral property held by her family in Pakistan and uses it to purchase property in India, she would be the absolute owner of that property. A landmark case affirmed that a widow who used such compensation to purchase property in India was competent to gift it to her son, and the gift was held valid.</p><h4 name="c5ae" id="c5ae" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Property Acquired After the Commencement of the Act:</strong></h4><p name="2cc3" id="2cc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, removes any incapability of a woman to acquire property as a full owner, whether the property was acquired before or after the Act’s commencement. This section ensures that a woman inherits property as an absolute owner, preventing potential conflicts and controversies. The phrase “whether acquired before or after the commencement of the Act” is crucial, as it clarifies that women hold property acquired at any time as absolute owners.</p><h4 name="c9ce" id="c9ce" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Conclusion:</strong></h4><p name="c18e" id="c18e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, empowers Hindu women by granting them absolute ownership over property acquired through various means, including gifts, personal skill or exertion, purchase, prescription, and other methods. The Act eliminates historical restrictions, allowing women to fully own and manage their property, thereby promoting gender equality and economic independence. The broad and inclusive nature of the provisions ensures that women can exercise their property rights without any limitations.</p></div></div></section><section name="979f" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="1418" id="1418" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Question: What are the provisions and implications of Section 14(2) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, regarding the limited estate expressly conferred under a will or an award?</strong></h3><h3 name="d9b0" id="d9b0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Answer:</strong></h3><h4 name="8249" id="8249" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Introduction:</strong></h4><p name="6580" id="6580" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, significantly reformed the property rights of Hindu women, particularly through Section 14, which aims to grant women absolute ownership over property.

It eliminates the difference between the acquisition of property based on the acquirer’s sex, allowing women to acquire property as full owners. However, it does not restrict the powers of a property owner to make dispositions according to their wishes. Thus, an owner can settle property in favor of a woman by creating a life interest, and this is permissible even after the Act’s commencement.</p><h4 name="2144" id="2144" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Provisions of Section 14(2):</strong></h4><p name="f3e6" id="f3e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Section 14(2) provides: “Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil court or under an award, where the terms of the gift, will, or other instrument or the decree, order or award prescribe a restricted estate in such property.”</p><p name="5388" id="5388" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This subsection protects the power of an owner to settle property in accordance with their wishes. If a female receives a limited interest in a property under a decree, award, gift, or will, such limited ownership would not be affected by Section 14(1) and would not mature into absolute ownership. This provision maintains the right of property owners to impose conditions and create limited estates even after the Act’s enactment.</p><h4 name="b1ed" id="b1ed" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Judicial Interpretation and Cases:</strong></h4><ol class="postList"><li name="4d8b" id="4d8b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">V.
