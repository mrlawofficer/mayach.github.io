The Act retains the joint family system and recognizes both separate and coparcenary property.</p><h4 name="cc98" id="cc98" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Historical Context and Arguments</h4><p name="6e63" id="6e63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Code Bill of 1948 aimed to abolish the Hindu Joint family system and the pious obligations of the son, proposing a uniform inheritance scheme for Hindu males. However, traditionalists resisted, arguing that the joint family system offered benefits such as unemployment insurance and old age security, and its abolition could lead to family disintegration and litigation. The Hindu Law Committee’s 1944 report favored retaining the Mitakshara doctrine, stating that sons should have a share in ancestral property equal to their father’s upon birth, and the doctrine of survivorship in coparcenary property should remain unchanged.</p><h4 name="f0af" id="f0af" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Legislative Changes and Gender Parity</h4><p name="08a8" id="08a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">By the time the first Hindu Succession Bill was introduced in 1954, no provisions recommended retaining the Mitakshara coparcenary. British Indian legislations had already modified the devolution of undivided shares in a coparcenary, promoting women’s rights. The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, was expected to enhance gender parity, moving away from son-preference and patriarchal ideologies.</p><h4 name="1fd6" id="1fd6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Notional Partition and Compromise</h4><p name="b636" id="b636" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The concept of notional partition emerged as a compromise between abolishing the joint family and coparcenary system and retaining it unchanged. This allowed the continuation of the Mitakshara coparcenary while enabling female and cognate relations to share in the ownership of coparcenary property under certain conditions. The 2005 amendment further modified the devolution of coparcenary property.</p><h4 name="fa62" id="fa62" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Conclusion</h4><p name="0b9a" id="0b9a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and subsequent amendments reflect a balance between traditional values and modern gender equality aspirations. The notional partition and the 2005 changes illustrate the dynamic evolution of property inheritance laws, accommodating both continuity and reform.</p></div></div></section><section name="1aa8" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="9721" id="9721" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Question: How did the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 address the devolution of interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property prior to the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005, and what changes did the 2005 amendment introduce?</h3><h3 name="d503" id="d503" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Answer:</h3><h4 name="699b" id="699b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Devolution of Interest in Coparcenary Property</h4><h4 name="0a4d" id="0a4d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Law as it Stood Prior to the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005</h4><p name="f788" id="f788" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, preserved the concept of the Mitakshara coparcenary system, which included a right by birth in favor of male descendants (son, grandson, and great-grandson). This traditional concept and the preferential rights for sons were explicitly retained, with statutory recognition for their continued application. Section 6 of the Act stated:</p><blockquote name="a738" id="a738" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“When a male Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his death, an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary, his interest in the property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act.”</em></blockquote><p name="1f0c" id="1f0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This provision affirmed the doctrine of survivorship, meaning that the undivided interest of a deceased coparcener would pass to the surviving coparceners rather than through testamentary or intestate succession.</p><h4 name="5f18" id="5f18" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Survivorship Replaced by Testamentary and Intestate Succession</h4><p name="33e6" id="33e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">However, the proviso to this section introduced a significant change by allowing the undivided interest of a deceased coparcener to devolve by testamentary or intestate succession instead of survivorship under certain conditions. The proviso reads:</p><blockquote name="030a" id="030a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Provided that, if the deceased had left him surviving a female relative specified in class-I of the schedule or a male relative specified in that class, who claims through such female relative, the interest of the deceased in the Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act, and not by survivorship.”</em></blockquote><p name="7cf6" id="7cf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This proviso has four key parts:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="0c2d" id="0c2d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">A Hindu male dies as an undivided member of a Mitakshara coparcenary.</li><li name="7eb9" id="7eb9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">He had an interest in the undivided coparcenary property.</li><li name="4e4e" id="4e4e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The deceased leaves behind a Class-I female heir or a Class-I male heir claiming through a female.</li><li name="e991" id="e991" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">His undivided interest in the Mitakshara coparcenary will devolve by testamentary or intestate succession, not by the doctrine of survivorship.</li></ol><h4 name="bcef" id="bcef" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Impact of the Proviso</h4><p name="e89b" id="e89b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This proviso fundamentally altered the application of the doctrine of survivorship by allowing female relatives (and male relatives claiming through them) to inherit the coparcenary interest of a deceased member. Before this amendment, coparcenary property devolution was predominantly male-centric, excluding females from inheritance.</p><h4 name="19fc" id="19fc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Changes Introduced by the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005</h4><p name="66ae" id="66ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act brought further changes to the devolution of coparcenary property by including daughters as coparceners. This amendment aimed to ensure gender equality by granting daughters the same rights as sons in coparcenary property. Specifically, it:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9c95" id="9c95" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Gave daughters equal rights in coparcenary property as sons, by birth.</li><li name="4b1a" id="4b1a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Allowed daughters to claim partition and dispose of their share through testamentary disposition.</li><li name="e160" id="e160" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Made daughters liable for the coparcenary property in the same manner as sons.</li></ol><h4 name="2eef" id="2eef" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion</h4><p name="4850" id="4850" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, initially preserved the traditional Mitakshara coparcenary system and the doctrine of survivorship. However, it introduced provisions to allow testamentary and intestate succession in the presence of certain heirs.</p><p name="e9a1" id="e9a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The 2005 amendment further advanced gender equality by recognizing daughters as coparceners, thereby allowing them equal inheritance rights in the joint family property.</p></div></div></section><section name="5508" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="46c0" id="46c0" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Question: What is the concept of notional partition under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and how does it affect the devolution of undivided interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property?</h3><h3 name="8adf" id="8adf" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Answer:</h3><h4 name="344e" id="344e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Notional Partition</h4><h4 name="8be6" id="8be6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Introduction</h4><p name="e573" id="e573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, introduced the concept of notional partition to alter the traditional devolution of undivided coparcenary interest by survivorship. Instead, it allowed for testamentary devolution or succession according to inheritance laws under certain conditions.</p><h4 name="e32c" id="e32c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Explanation I: Concept of Notional Partition</h4><p name="d2d6" id="d2d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To address the question of what interest a deceased coparcener’s share would be available for succession, Explanation I appended to the proviso of Section 6 provides:</p><blockquote name="f038" id="f038" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“For the purposes of this section, the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled to claim partition or not.”</em></blockquote><h4 name="529a" id="529a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--blockquote">Legal or Fictional Partition</h4><p name="389c" id="389c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The proviso incorporates the idea of a legal or fictional partition. This means that the undivided interest left by the deceased will be divided as though a partition had occurred before his death. The deceased is legally presumed to have died after demanding partition, effectively creating a severance of status within the joint family as far as the deceased is concerned.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="7ab0" id="7ab0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Presumption of Partition</strong>: The law presumes that before the coparcener’s death, he had demanded a partition. This presumption applies even if the coparcener did not have the right to claim partition.</li><li name="21b5" id="21b5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Competence to Demand Partition</strong>: Generally, every major coparcener who is of sound mind can demand partition at his pleasure. A minor coparcener, who cannot directly demand partition from the Karta (head of the family), must rely on a next friend to file a suit for partition in a court of law.</li><li name="aaf1" id="aaf1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Application to All Coparceners</strong>: The presumption of notional partition before death applies to all coparceners, whether they had the legal right to demand partition or not. This includes minor coparceners who typically do not have the standing to demand partition independently.</li></ol><h4 name="fb76" id="fb76" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Impact of Notional Partition</h4><p name="e446" id="e446" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The concept of notional partition significantly impacts the devolution of property:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="2925" id="2925" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">It shifts the undivided coparcenary interest from automatic devolution by survivorship to a method where the deceased’s share is determined and distributed through testamentary or intestate succession.</li><li name="680a" id="680a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It allows female heirs, included in Class-I of the Schedule, to inherit the deceased’s coparcenary interest, promoting gender equality in inheritance rights.</li></ul><h4 name="71e5" id="71e5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion</h4><p name="d1da" id="d1da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The introduction of the notional partition under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, provides a mechanism to ensure that the undivided interest of a deceased coparcener is fairly distributed among heirs, including female relatives. This concept balances the traditional coparcenary system with modern inheritance laws, promoting more equitable distribution of property.</p></div></div></section><section name="5b56" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="39a3" id="39a3" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Question: Who are the heirs whose presence alters the devolution of undivided interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property?</h3><h3 name="0b99" id="0b99" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3">Answer:</h3><h4 name="083d" id="083d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Heirs Whose Presence Alters Devolution</h4><h4 name="394b" id="394b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4">Introduction</h4><p name="4151" id="4151" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The devolution of undivided interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property can shift from the doctrine of survivorship to succession preceded by notional partition if certain heirs are present at the time of the coparcener’s death. This mechanism is designed to ensure the participation of female heirs in the inheritance process, promoting gender equality.</p><h4 name="5aca" id="5aca" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Conditions for Notional Partition</h4><p name="545a" id="545a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">For notional partition to apply and for the doctrine of survivorship to be defeated, the deceased must have left behind either a Class-I female heir or a male Class-I heir claiming through a female heir.</p><h4 name="5f62" id="5f62" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Class-I Heirs Before 2005</h4><p name="cbf3" id="cbf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Prior to the 2005 amendment, the Class-I heirs included twelve heirs, of which eight were females.

This approach does not extend the consequences of a real partition to other family members, whether male or female. It operates under the principle that the partition is presumed only to calculate the deceased’s interest, and once this share is determined, there is no need to allocate shares to other family members.</p><h4 name="5a75" id="5a75" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Example of Narrow Approach:</strong></h4><ul class="postList"><li name="12e3" id="12e3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">A Hindu family consists of father F, his wife W, and their son S.

According to this approach, once the share of the deceased coparcener is ascertained, the consequences of a real partition should follow. This means that female members who would be entitled to a share in a real partition must also receive their due share.

It states that the interest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener is deemed to be the share he would have received if a partition had taken place immediately before his death, irrespective of his entitlement to claim partition. This suggests that the legislature intended to ensure that the share of the deceased coparcener is accurately determined and that the consequences of a real partition should follow.</p><h4 name="acbf" id="acbf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Conclusion</strong></h4><p name="bef2" id="bef2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The extent and effect of notional partition under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, can be understood through both narrow and wider approaches. The narrow approach limits the partition’s impact to ascertaining the deceased’s share, while the wider approach ensures equitable distribution to all entitled heirs, including females. The legislative intent, as indicated by Explanation I, supports the wider approach to ensure fair treatment for female heirs and to reflect the consequences of a real partition.</p></div></div></section><section name="1024" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="240c" id="240c" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Question: How did the court’s decision in Kanna Gounder’s case interpret the concept of notional partition and its impact on the widow’s rights over the coparcenary property?</strong></h3><h3 name="c0ed" id="c0ed" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Answer:</strong></h3><h4 name="1bbc" id="1bbc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Analysis of Kanna Gounder’s Case</strong></h4><h4 name="b381" id="b381" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Introduction</strong></h4><p name="62da" id="62da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The concept of notional partition under the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, plays a crucial role in determining the share of a deceased coparcener and its devolution among heirs.

Abolition of the Doctrine of Survivorship</h4><p name="2285" id="2285" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Before the 2005 amendment, the doctrine of survivorship governed the devolution of a coparcener’s interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary upon his death. This meant that the deceased’s interest automatically passed to the surviving coparceners. However, the amendment has abolished this doctrine for male intestates, ensuring that the interest is now devolved through testamentary or intestate succession instead.</p><h4 name="5eeb" id="5eeb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">2. Devolution by Testamentary or Intestate Succession</h4><p name="035a" id="035a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Section 6(3) of the amended Act stipulates that upon the death of a Hindu male coparcener after the commencement of the amendment, his interest in the joint Hindu family property shall devolve by testamentary or intestate succession. This change ensures that the deceased’s interest is distributed as per his will (if any) or according to the rules of intestate succession, rather than automatically passing to the surviving coparceners.</p><h4 name="2361" id="2361" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">3. Concept of Notional Partition</h4><p name="1541" id="1541" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Although the doctrine of survivorship has been abolished, the concept of notional partition is retained for calculating the deceased coparcener’s share. The notional partition is deemed to have taken place immediately before the coparcener’s death, allowing for the accurate determination of his share in the joint family property. This share is then distributed according to the deceased’s will or the rules of intestate succession.</p><h4 name="74b1" id="74b1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">4. Impact on Female Heirs</h4><p name="cf5b" id="cf5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">One of the most significant changes introduced by the amendment is the recognition of daughters as coparceners in the same manner as sons. This means that daughters now have an equal right to their father’s coparcenary property. This provision ensures gender equality in inheritance and aligns with modern legal principles of fairness and justice.</p><h4 name="7cc4" id="7cc4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">5. Application of the Amendment Act</h4><p name="fc0b" id="fc0b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The following factors must be considered when distributing the share of a coparcener who dies as an undivided member of a Mitakshara coparcenary:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5caa" id="5caa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Membership in Mitakshara Coparcenary</strong>: The deceased coparcener must be a member of the Mitakshara coparcenary.</li><li name="f1c9" id="f1c9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Death After 9th September 2005</strong>: The death must occur after the commencement of the amendment.</li><li name="f693" id="f693" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Calculation of Share</strong>: The deceased’s share must be calculated after effecting a notional partition.</li><li name="2898" id="2898" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Testamentary Succession</strong>: If the deceased has left a valid will, the share is distributed according to the will’s instructions.</li><li name="717c" id="717c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Intestate Succession</strong>: In the absence of a will, the share is distributed according to the rules of intestate succession under the Act.</li><li name="c4fc" id="c4fc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Inclusion of Daughters</strong>: Daughters must be allotted a share as they are now coparceners, similar to sons.</li></ul><h4 name="d0d2" id="d0d2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Conclusion</strong></h4><p name="5df9" id="5df9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 has brought about crucial reforms in the devolution of coparcenary interest within a Mitakshara joint family. By abolishing the doctrine of survivorship and recognizing daughters as coparceners, the amendment promotes gender equality and ensures a more equitable distribution of property. The concept of notional partition continues to play a vital role in determining the deceased coparcener’s share, which is then distributed according to testamentary or intestate succession rules.</p></div></div></section><section name="81c3" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3341" id="3341" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Question: How are the shares of coparcenary property distributed under the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 when a coparcener dies as an undivided member of a Mitakshara coparcenary?</strong></h3><h3 name="2502" id="2502" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h3-strong">Answer:</strong></h3><h4 name="c009" id="c009" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Introduction</strong></h4><p name="318a" id="318a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005 significantly altered the way coparcenary property is distributed when a coparcener dies.
